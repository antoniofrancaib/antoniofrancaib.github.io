      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" target="_blank">"Broken Windows" theory</a> says that small signs of deterioration, like a broken window in an abandoned building, can eventually lead to significant social deterioration. Indeed, <a href="https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/artpub/2023/287681/intjougeo_a2023_v12n449.pdf" target="_blank">studies</a> show how the accumulation of trash in the streets statistically correlates with rising crime rates.</p>
      <p>I find a clear analogy, on a personal level, to this phenomenon: every time one fails to commit to themselves, this acts as a broken window in their discipline.</p>
      <p>Daily habits can have a disproportionate impact on achieving larger goals. Something as simple as making bed at the start of the day, or dressing well not only organizes the environment but also the mind.</p>
      <p>Breaking one of these habits might be taken as non-significant in the moment, but that small crack can easily compound and slowly erode the strength of our character in the long-term.</p>
      <p>Further, there are habits of greater importance, such as doing high-intensity sports regularly, eating healthily, going to bed at time, or doing deep-work on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Beyond the significant impact of those actions on our lives, the reason to expose to this kind of hard things is rather simple: every time we confront something that takes effort, we gain control over our mind.</p>
      <p>These actions are not (just) an end in themselves; but also training for mental resilience, a meaningful way to build character. This creates a virtuous cycle: the more consistent we are in doing challenging things, the easier it becomes to stay consistent, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>That’s why every action reinforces a narrative: either you act with self-respect and intention, or you give in to weakness. It's mostly always good to take always the pain upfront, and be prepared in advance so that when we face that moment of weakness, you’ll remember: don’t break your windows.</p>

This term at Cambridge has been an incredible journey filled with research collaborations, teaching experiences, and the unique academic environment that makes this university so special.

In this post, I'll share some insights about my academic transition, the research I've been involved with, and how my perspective on machine learning has evolved since arriving here.

## Academic Environment

The collegiate system at Cambridge creates a uniquely collaborative environment. I've found myself discussing research ideas with scholars from diverse fields - from computational neuroscientists to philosophers of mind - which has broadened my perspectives on artificial intelligence research.

The supervision system, where we meet in small groups with faculty members, has been particularly valuable. These in-depth discussions have pushed me to refine my thinking and articulate my ideas more precisely.

## Research Focus

I've been focusing on computational models of memory formation, extending my previous work on hippocampal memory systems. Working with the Computational and Biological Learning Lab has exposed me to cutting-edge approaches in neural network interpretability.

A particularly exciting development has been applying some of the theoretical frameworks I've been developing to real neuroimaging data, bridging the gap between computational theory and experimental neuroscience.

## Teaching Experiences

I've had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate machine learning course. Explaining complex concepts to students has been rewarding and has deepened my own understanding of the fundamentals.

The questions students ask often highlight aspects of machine learning that I've taken for granted, forcing me to reconsider basic assumptions and strengthen my conceptual foundation.

## Looking Forward

As I look ahead to the rest of the academic year, I'm excited to delve deeper into my research and establish more collaborations across departments. Cambridge's rich intellectual environment continues to inspire and challenge me in ways I hadn't anticipated.

I'll be sharing more specific research updates in future posts, including some preliminary results from our work on memory consolidation mechanisms in recurrent neural networks.

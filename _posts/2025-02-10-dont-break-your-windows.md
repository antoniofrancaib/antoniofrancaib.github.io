The [broken windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) suggests that small signs of deterioration, like a broken window in an abandoned building, can lead to more chaos and disorder if not repaired promptly. In sociology, a compelling example could be the hypothesis that the accumulation of trash on the streets of Barcelona might have contributed to an increase in crime ([article](https://ddd.uab.cat/pub/artpub/2023/287681/intjougeo_a2023_v12n449.pdf)).

On a personal level, every time you fail to commit to yourself, it's like a broken window in your system of discipline. If we allow these cracks to remain, they become entry points for disorder in other areas of life. Chaos, much like in the original theory, thrives on neglect.

In my experience, I've seen how small, everyday actions can have a disproportionate impact on achieving larger goals. Something as simple as tidying up your room, making your bed at the start of the day, or dressing well not only organizes your environment but also your mind.

These actions create a sense of order that drives us to face the day with greater clarity. When these small victories are strung together, they put us in a state of optimal performance that can transform our daily goals.

Of course, there are habits of greater significance, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, or maintaining good hygiene—both physical and sleep-related. These not only improve our health but also strengthen our character.

Breaking a healthy habit might seem insignificant in the moment, but that small crack can slowly erode our sense of discipline. And the problem with erosion is that it is asymmetrically one-directional: it's always easier to break something than to build it.

Why does it make sense to wake up at 6 a.m., take cold showers, or tackle uncomfortable tasks? Beyond the tangible impact of these actions on our lives, the reason is simple: every time we confront something that takes effort, we gain control over our mind. These actions are not (just) an end in themselves; they are training for mental resilience.

It's a virtuous cycle: the more consistent we are in doing challenging things, the easier it becomes to stay in a state of excellence. Each challenge overcome reinforces our sense of accomplishment, driving positive momentum that elevates us to a higher state of consciousness. That momentum—a chain of small personal victories—is what enables us to operate at our best.

When we live outside that momentum, we fall into a state of life suboptimality. It's a place where our aspirations fade, where we settle for what is easy and comfortable, but also where dissatisfaction takes root. Suboptimality isn't necessarily a visible disaster; it's simply a silent underutilization of our potential.

That's why every habit counts. Every small action you take reinforces a narrative: either you're moving toward your best self, or you're allowing the broken windows of procrastination and laziness to multiply.

The key to thriving in all areas of life is to build momentum, maintain it, and leverage it to the fullest, taking full advantage of the power of compound interest. Doing hard things isn't a punishment; it's a privilege that empowers us to be better every day. In discipline lies true freedom.

So, prepare in advance so that when you face moments of weakness, you'll remember: don't break your windows (nor let others break them).
